# OSU AIAA

The OSU AIAA branch was founded by people who have a passion for aerospace. Our
goal is to promote aerospace education and experience. We believe that as
Engineers we should be capable of building what we design. This means that we
are a very product oriented organization that is dedicated to making our
designs fly.

## Club Goals

- Provide hands-on aerospace engineering projects/student competitions
- Offer opportunities for members to visit aerospace companies, facilities, and
  conferences
- Invite notable aerospace speakers to OSU to give presentations to members
- Help introduce aerospace electives back into the OSU engineering curriculum
- Encourage aerospace career opportunities
- Solicit industry partnership with OSU AIAA
